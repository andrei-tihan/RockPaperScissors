# RockPaperScissors
### By Andrei Tihan

The classic Rock, Paper, Scissors we all know! This is my first program in Python, built from scratch.
I created this as part of a bootcamp on Machine Learning and AI with Python for beginners to programming, so go easy on me!

Currently, it supports the basic rock, paper, scissors that we all know and love. However, I have set up the modularity needed to expand it with further additions like lizard and spock if need be.

I would like to refactor the win condition logic to remove repetition in the code and allow for as many additional hand options as needed.

I would also like to add "best out of 3" and "best out of 5" gamemode options that automatically end the game and tell you who won at the end.

Finally, I would like to add a small easter egg that takes advantage of the random library to give you a hint as to how to trigger the easter egg.

Thank you for playing my first Python program and take care!
